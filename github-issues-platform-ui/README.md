This directory contains the link to the repository setup to interact with Zapier via a Platform UI Private App that I developed.

Through the link below, you will also get:
1. Instruction on How to use the App
2. The invite link to use the App

Private apps are integrations that are under active development, or created for private use on Zapierâ€™s developer platform. 
They are used to connect any API with the 1000's of apps on Zapier.
